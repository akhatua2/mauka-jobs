## Inspiration

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is estimated that the unemployment rate in the world has massively risen especially in developing nations. Additionally, after researching solutions that assist in finding job opportunities catering to users in developing nations, we found some current solutions to be confusing to navigate. With this rising problem in mind, our team was hoping to devise a solution to assist the unemployed in developing countries through Mauka. To help that have lost their job, we decided to only have those roles which were entry level, so that people could use the resources to learn on their own time, and then apply to that specific role.

## What it does

Mauka is a user-friendly web application for users in developing nations to learn more about job opportunities around them. Once a user enters their city in the main search bar, they will be directed to a webpage where they can see the job roles with their corresponding job openings and average salary. Mauka also offers a simple “Demand” bar which displays how sought-after a job role is. If a user is appealed by the job role, Mauka allows them to explore more details about the role such as valuable interview preparation resources and a concise breakdown of which companies are recruiting candidates for such a role.
